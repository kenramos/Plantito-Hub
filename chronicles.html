        <h2>A happy plant family</h2>
        <p>
          At first, I tried with just one plant - the snake plant. But in just a
          few weeks, I got addicted to the feeling of taking care of plants.
          Usually, I would buy just one new plant every week. Until I got so
          excited that in one sitting, I bought all of the plants you can see in
          the picture. And in a span of two months, I bought almost 20 new
          plants. And here they are now, posing happily for their plant family
          picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always excited looking at new plants. Or then again, maybe it's
          just my impatience. I get fussy waiting for my plants to grow, leading
          me to buying new plants over and over again.

          <h2>Basking in the sunlight</h2>
          <p>
            Plants need sunlight. But different plants have different light
            requirements. It is always important to know how much sun your plant
            child needs. Otherwise, you might end up with drying leaves or
            fading colors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people find it difficult looking for the perfect spot for their
            plants to receive the light they need. Fortunately, the morning sun
            reaches my window perfectly. Thus, the sunbathing plants.

          <h2>Challenging plants for me</h2>
          <p>Meet the white serissa and spider plant.</p>
          <p>
            Some say that taking care of these plants are easy. This is why I
            was eager to buy these two babies. Three months have passed but I
            still have to find the correct conditions to make them grow
            beautifully. I have moved them to at least 3 different spots. I have
            also tried experimenting with their watering schedules. All for
            naught. Their leaves continue to fall. I am now afraid that they may
            be having root rot. Next week, I will try to repot them. Hope it
            works.

          <h2>Propagating, finally</h2>
          <p>
            The snake plant is the very first plant I bought. My friends told me
            that it is a hardy plant and low-maintenance, perfect for a newbie
            plantito like me. True enough, my original snake plant has already
            borne a baby plant. And now, I am trying my hand in propagating it
            thru their leaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a sense of fulfillment in being able to see these leaf
            cuttings grow roots. It took a few weeks, but finally they are ready
            to be put in soil. Who knows, I might be able to grow a whole bunch
            of snake plants which I can give away.

          <h2>A trio of plants</h2>
          <p>Meet the jade plant, red fittonia and the zebra plant.</p>
          <p>
            For some reason, I am always happy when I see these three plants
            together. They show different aspects which I like about them. The
            jade plant is a lush plant. The red fittonia adds color. While the
            zebra plant looks very strong despite being small. I just love these
            three.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if there's one thing I don't like, it's that these three plants
            have very different care requirements. Which is why even though I
            like seeing them together, I have to place them apart. Huhuhu.

          <h2>Second trio</h2>
          <p>These guys were gifts from my friend. Thank you, friend.</p>
          <p>
            The pachira, or money tree, is very slow growing. The neon pothos,
            on the other hand, grows quickly but some of its leaves dried up
            quickly as well. I guess that's the hazard of being taken care of by
            a newbie. But the bacularis is the one I like most among the three.
            It is very low maintenance but at the same time, its greenness is
            very relaxing to the eyes.

          <h2>The first death</h2>
          <p>It's heartbreaking but one of my plants have died.</p>
          <p>
            I don't know exactly what I did wrong. But my guess is that I was
            overeager in watering it, resulting in it having root rot. I really
            need to keep my impatience in check. I guess I had this notion that
            watering it frequently will help it grow. Turns out I was wrong.
          </p>
          <p>Goodbye, dear coleus.</p>
